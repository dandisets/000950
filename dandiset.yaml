description: 'The dataset contains neural activity from participant T5, who gave informed
  consent and was enrolled in the BrainGate2 Neural Interface System clinical trial
  (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00912041, registered June 3, 2009). This pilot
  clinical trial was approved under an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) by the
  US Food and Drug Administration (Investigational Device Exemption #G090003). Permission
  was also granted by the Institutional Review Boards of Stanford University (protocol
  #20804).


  Data was recorded from two 96-channel intracortical electrode arrays in the hand
  "knob" area of of T5''s left hemisphere precentral gyrus. On each trial, T5 was
  prompted to copy a cued sentence by writing individual characters, separated by
  a ">" space character. Decoded letters appeared on the screen below the prompt.'
